        Agreement when it has any reasonable belief of fraudulent or 
        unlawful activity by You or Your employees or of a violation of any

        obligations, or liabilities hereunder.

        the Parties hereto.  You may not assign this agreement without the 
        University’s prior written approval.
    g. This EULA shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with 
        United States copyright law and the laws of the State of Maryland 
        without reference to its conflicts of laws rules.  Nothing in this 
        EULA is or shall be deemed to be a waiver by University of any of 
        its rights or status as an agency and instrumentality of the 
        State of Maryland. 
    h. This EULA represents the entire agreement between You and the 
        University with respect to the Software and supersedes all prior 
        or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, 
        oral, or written between You and University regarding the Software.  
        If You require use of a purchase order or similar document in order 
        to pay the license fee, any terms on such a document are hereby 
        rejected and null and void.
